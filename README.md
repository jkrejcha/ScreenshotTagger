# ScreenshotTagger
Adds metadata to screenshots for easier and later retrieval and reminders

This is mostly a personal use utility for me. I use screenshots as a reminder
tool and so that's what this is for mostly. The database is stored separate 
from the actual screenshots themselves so it can be copied around easily and it
isn't destructive on the actual files.

The initial version of this isn't intended to be super well-polished.
